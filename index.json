So, if put your laptop to sleep for a couple of minutes and the laptop is pretty old. It wastes a bunch of battery. Now this can be solved by using hibernation instead of sleep.

However, I will link where you can find how to set it up with a partition below.\nNote #This will also work on an encrypted Pop!_OS install.\nSetup swapfile #Use custom script #You can also use a script I made instead.\n# Grab the file and make it excutable curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thecodeofdaniel/scripts/main/hibernation.sh \u0026amp;\u0026amp; chmod u+x hibernation.sh # Run the script ./hibernation Setup manually ## Create swapfile and add to fstab file.
