A graduate computer science student from CSUF, residing in LA. I'm passionate
about exploring the vast realm of technology. From building web applications to
building computers and servers. I thrive on the challenges and creative
opportunities they offer. Beyond that, I enjoy weight lifting, playing
basketball, and I also enjoy finding new music in all kinds of genres including
metal, electronic, and hip-hop.
