My name is Daniel Rubio, and I'm currently an undergraduate computer science student at CSUF, residing in LA County. I'm passionate about exploring the vast realm of technology, particularly in the realms of Linux, open-source software, and Information Technology. I'm always eager to learn and innovate.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I actively engage in various projects, both software, and hardware, to broaden my skill set and contribute to the tech community. From building web applications to building an efficient and low wattage home server. I thrive on the challenges and creative opportunities they offer.

Beyond that, I enjoy pushing myself at the gym through weight lifting exercises. Watching and playing basketball. And I also enjoy finding new music in either rock, shoegaze, or metal. Later down the line, I hope to learn the electric guitar and create my own music!

I'm excited about the prospect of leveraging my skills and passion in technology to make a meaningful impact and assist others. Whether it's collaborating on projects or sharing knowledge within the community, I'm committed to pushing boundaries and driving positive change in the world of tech.
