I'm currently an undergraduate computer science student at CSUF, residing in LA.
I'm passionate about exploring the vast realm of technology. From building
web/mobile applications to building efficient and low wattage home servers. I
thrive on the challenges and creative opportunities they offer. Beyond that, I
enjoy weight lifting, playing basketball, and I also enjoy finding new music in
all kinds of genres including metal, electronic, and hip-hop.
